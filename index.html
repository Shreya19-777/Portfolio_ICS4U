                In this course I was introduced to git and github which helped
                me throughout the entirety of the semester. I will continue to
                learn the coding concepts I became familiarized with in this
                course to have more complex programs and to continue to share my
                work on github with others using what I learned about github in
                this course. The aspects of this course that has the most
                significant impacs on me as a student was working with git.
                Before this course I had never worked with version control like
                git but working trough this course allowed to become more
                familiar and comfrotabe working with it which will incredibly
                important in the future because of how much version control is
                growing in the programming community.

                This second course acted as a refresher for javascript, which I
                used in grade 9 but did not use last year so I had forgotten
                some of the principles. I was reintroduced to concepts I had
                already learned but I also learned many more complex coding
                concepts like classes and objects. I will continue to use
                this knowledge of complex coding concepts in the future to
                create complex coding projects by utilizing classes and objects
                like what I did in the live coding challenge. The part of this
                course that impacted me the most was working with classes. I
                struggled to understand the difference between classes and
                functions when I began the course but, as I continued using them
                in my code I began to understand the difference. In simple
                terms, classes help to provide structure to the code but they do
                not execute tasks, unlike functions which execute certain tasks.

          <body>
            The third course I worked through on Codecademy was the
            <strong>Create a Backend App with Javascript</strong>. This app had
            a bit of an overlap with the javascript learned in creating a
            front-end app with React, but there were a lot of new computer
            science principles that I learned. I will continue to use what I
            learned in this course to try and implement a backend to future
            websites that I code. That is something that I wanted to do for the
            hackathon website but did not have the time to do it. The aspect of
            this course that impacted me the most is learning about the
            principles of what a backend is and why it is very important to
            have. It is something I had very little prior knowledge about before
            starting the course but, in the lessons, I was able to learn
            about what it is and I found it to be very interesting.

        <body>
          While working through this course at Khan Academy I learned a great
          deal about algorithms. I learned about several different ways of
          sorting values in an array such as selection sort, insertion sort,
          merge sort, and quick sort. Not only did I learn about sorting but I
          learned about asymptotic notation, which is the running time of an
          algorithm, learning about big O, big Theta, and big Omega. I will
          continue to use what I learned in the future to help evaluate the
          efficiency of my programs in the future to make sure they have good
          runtimes. My favourite aspect of this course was learning about
          asymptotic notation because I found it very neat that there was a way
          to compare runtimes of algorithms without actually having to run them
          carefully.

                  This was the first project I worked through while working with
                  a pyraminx. This project helped me to get a much more thorough
                  understanding of algorithms and how they are used in everyday
                  life and helped me to work on my problem-solving skills. I
                  will continue to use what I learned about solving the pyraminx
                  and finding patterns when coding in the future. This will
                  allow me to approach coding problems with a new and better
                  problem-solving perspective. The aspect of this course that
                  impacted me the most was that it was a challenge for me. I
                  spent a long time struggling and being unable to solve the
                  cube because I couldn't identify and learn the algorithms
                  necessary to solve it. It took me over a week to finally start
                  recognizing patterns and using specific algorithms to solve
                  the cube. The more I worked with the cube and became more
                  comfortable with it, the more I was able to identify patterns
                  quicker and the time it took me to solve it was, generally,
                  decreasing steadily.

                  This was the second project we did this year working with the
                  pyraminx and the corner twisting pyraminx. While leading this
                  course I was in charge of the team blindfold solve. While
                  watching people communicate with their partners to solve the
                  cube, I learned a lot about what was the most efficient way to
                  communicate and solve the cube in the least amount of times
                  with the fewest moves. I will continue to use this information
                  about what was the most effective way to communicate in the
                  future when working with groups and others whether it's in
                  computer science or in other classes as well. I found the
                  most successful groups were the ones who used
                  specific vocabulary for each piece of the cube and some groups
                  even labeled each piece before starting the activity so they
                  would be on the same page. I found the groups that were less
                  successful were the ones who didn't use specific vocabulary and
                  who got frustrated with their partners so I know that it is
                  important to remain level-headed and not get frustrated when
                  working with others because it only makes things worse. I
                  think seeing the different techniques and seeing the progress
                  that people made throughout the course is what impacted me the
                  most. I know that a lot of people were afraid of failing or of
                  not being able to solve the cube but by the end, I could see
                  that they were much more confident with solving and I think
                  seeing that progress was great to see.

                In this project, I learned a lot about creating interactive
                websites using React. I was able to implement the skills I
                learned in the Codecademy course on React to create an
                interactive website with multiple pages and buttons to create
                for more user interaction. I will continue to use this in the
                future to create more complex websites and more towards adding a
                backend which is something we weren't able to do. I think the
                part of this project that impacted me the most was being able to
                create multiple games that would allow users to interact in
                different settings and environments and play a variety of games
                that would allow them to get the most out of the project. I also
                think our use of having a website that is purely
                educational and shares facts also having games appeals to
                different audiences with different learning styles and helps the
                users to get the most out of our project.

                For the live coding challenge, my group picked the challenge
                <strong>#111: Animated Sprites</strong>. In this project I
                learned a lot more about object-oriented programming and was
                able to use more complex functions and methods. I learned about
                parameters, methods, incrementors and so many more complex coding
                concepts that were used to create the game. I will continue to
                use what I learned in this project in the future, especially if
                I want to create a videogame I have been able to move objects in
                different directions but being able to animate it as well and
                making it look like it's moving would be a great addition and
                a step towards more complex games. The aspect of this project that
                impacted me the most was learning about how to animate objects
                as well as the history of animation. I did a lot of research
                about how animation was made in the past and I found it really
                interesting to see how far we've come and the advancements in
                technology that is leading to more realistic and 3D animations
                in the future.

                While watching the different presentations and following along

                projects.
