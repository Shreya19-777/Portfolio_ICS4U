            Welcome to my ICS4U Computer Science Portfolio! In this portfolio I
            will be sharing a total of 10 projects and modules I've worked
            through over the semester. For each project I will explain how I
            will continue to use what I learned in each project in the future
            and it's impact on me.

                In this course I was introduced to git and github which helped
                me throughout the entirety of the semester. I will continue to
                learn the coding concepts I became familiarized with in this
                course to have more complex programs and to continue to share my
                work on github with others using what I learned about github in
                this course. The aspects of this course that has the most
                significant impacs on me as a student was working with git.
                Before this course I had never worked with version control like
                git but working trough this course allowed to become more
                familiar and comfrotabe working with it which will incredibly
                important in the future because of how much version control is
                growing in the programming community.

                This second course acted as a refresher for javascript, which I
                used in grade 9 but did not use last year so I had forgotten
                some of the principles. I was reintroduced to concepts I had
                already learned but I also learned many more complex coding
                concepts like classes and objects. I will continue to use this
                knowledge of complex coding concepts in the future to create
                complex coding projects by utilizing classes and objects like
                what I did in the live coding challenge. The part of this course
                that impacted me the most was working with classes. I struggled
                to understand the difference between classes and functions when
                I began the course but, as I continued using them in my code I
                began to understand the difference. In simple terms, classes
                help to provide structure to the code but they do not execute
                tasks, unlike functions which execute certain tasks.

                  The third course I worked through on Codecademy was the
                  <strong>Create a Backend App with Javascript</strong>. This
                  app had a bit of an overlap with the javascript learned in
                  creating a front-end app with React, but there were a lot of
                  new computer science principles that I learned. I will
                  continue to use what I learned in this course to try and
                  implement a backend to future websites that I code. That is
                  something that I wanted to do for the hackathon website but
                  did not have the time to do it. The aspect of this course that
                  impacted me the most is learning about what a backend is and
                  why it is very important to have. On a website, the backend
                  can store and organize data. It is something I had very little
                  prior knowledge about before starting the course but, in the
                  lessons, I was able to learn about what it is and I found it
                  to be very interesting.

                  In this course, I worked through several lessons including
                  <strong>randomness</strong>, <strong>noise</strong>,
                  <strong>vectors</strong> etc. One of the main parts of this
                  unit was adding movement to objects and I will continue to use
                  that in the future to be able to create more complex movement,
                  including acceleration, and many other speeds and types of
                  movement. I learned about the create vector function and many
                  more physics concpets in computer science. The thing I
                  struggled with the most was noise. I was confused with
                  animated noise especially but as I continued to work through
                  it I began to understand how it works and was able to complete
                  the challenges for it. I was most impacted by the
                  incorporation of physics in computer sicence. I thought it was
                  really neat to see that a lot of concepts that I was learning
                  about in physics like, vectors, forces, kinematics etc, could
                  be incorporated and merged with computer science.

                While working through this course at Khan Academy I learned a
                great deal about algorithms. I learned about several different
                ways of sorting values in an array such as selection sort,
                insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort. Not only did I learn
                about sorting but I learned about
                <strong>asymptotic notation</strong>, which is the running time
                of an algorithm, which included learning about big O, big Theta,
                and big Omega. I will continue to use what I learned in the
                future to help evaluate the efficiency of my programs ensuring
                they have good runtimes. My favourite aspect of this course was
                learning about asymptotic notation because I found it very neat
                that there was a way to compare runtimes of algorithms without
                actually having to run them carefully.

              <body>
                In this course I learned about a variety of new coding concpets
                like <strong>heuristics</strong>, which is a way to solve
                problems by getting an approximate solution,
                <strong>parallel computing</strong>, a way to speed up
                algorithms by spreading them out and having them run
                simultaneously, and <strong>categorizing run time</strong>, a
                way to determine if the algorithm takes the same amount of time
                to run each time or if it varies. I will continue to use what I
                learned in this course in the future when comparing efficieny
                and run times of algorithms and determining whether my program
                is efficient. My the aspect of the course that impacted me the
                most was realizing the importance of algorithms in computer
                science and how they are found everywhere in coding. Alogrithms
                are a crucial part of coding and computer science.

                  This was the first project I worked through while working with
                  a pyraminx. This project helped me to get a much more thorough
                  understanding of algorithms and how they are used in everyday
                  life and helped me to work on my problem-solving skills. I
                  will continue to use what I learned about solving the pyraminx
                  and finding patterns when coding in the future. This will
                  allow me to approach coding problems with a new and better
                  problem-solving perspective. The aspect of this course that
                  impacted me the most was that it was a challenge for me. I
                  spent a long time struggling and being unable to solve the
                  cube because I couldn't identify and learn the algorithms
                  necessary to solve it. It took me over a week to finally start
                  recognizing patterns and using specific algorithms to solve
                  the cube. The more I worked with the cube and became more
                  comfortable with it, the more I was able to identify patterns
                  quicker and the time it took me to solve it was, generally,
                  decreasing steadily.

                  This was the second project I did while using the pyraminx as
                  a learning tool. I learned a lot about what was the most
                  efficient way to communicate and solve the cube with the
                  fewest moves for the team blindfold solve. I will continue to
                  use the communication tactics that I saw were most efficient
                  when working in groups or with others in the future. I found
                  the most successful groups were the ones who used specific
                  vocabulary for each piece of the cube and some groups even
                  labeled each piece before starting the activity so they would
                  be on the same page. I know that it is important to remain
                  level-headed and not get frustrated when working with others
                  because it only makes things worse, which was one of my
                  observations. I think seeing the different techniques and
                  seeing the progress that people made throughout the course is
                  what impacted me the most. I know that a lot of people were
                  afraid of failing or of not being able to solve the cube but
                  by the end, I could see that they were much more confident
                  with solving and I think seeing that progress was great to
                  see.

                In this project, I learned a lot about creating interactive
                websites using React. I was able to implement the skills I
                learned in the Codecademy course on React to create an
                interactive website with multiple pages and buttons to create
                for more user interaction. I will continue to use this in the
                future to create more complex websites and more towards adding a
                backend which is something we weren't able to do. I think the
                part of this project that impacted me the most was being able to
                create multiple games that would allow users to interact in
                different settings and environments and play a variety of games
                that would allow them to get the most out of the project. I also
                think our use of having a website that is purely educational and
                shares facts also having games appeals to different audiences
                with different learning styles and helps the users to get the
                most out of our project.

                For the live coding challenge, my group picked the challenge
                <strong>#111: Animated Sprites</strong>. In this project I
                learned a lot more about object-oriented programming and was
                able to use more complex functions and methods. I learned about
                parameters, methods, incrementors and so many more complex
                coding concepts that were used to create the game. I will
                continue to use what I learned in this project in the future,
                especially if I want to create a videogame I have been able to
                move objects in different directions but being able to animate
                it as well and making it look like it's moving would be a great
                addition and a step towards more complex games. The aspect of
                this project that impacted me the most was learning about how to
                animate objects as well as the history of animation. I did a lot
                of research about how animation was made in the past and I found
                it really interesting to see how far we've come and the
                advancements in technology that is leading to more realistic and
                3D animations in the future.
