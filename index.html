            This is my Grade 12 Computer Science Portfolio. This portfolio is a
            collection of courses and projects I've wokred through over the
            semseter. This webiste is to display what I've learned and how I
            will continue to use it in the future.

        <h2>#1: Learn Git and Github</h2>

        <div class="menu">
          <p>
            In this course I was introduced to git and github which helped me
            throughout the entirety of the semester. I will continue to learn
            the coding concepts I became familiarized with in this course to
            have more complex programs and to continue to share my work on
            github with others using what I learned about github in this course.
            The aspects of this course that has the most significant impacs on
            me as a student was working with git. Before this course I had never
            worked with version control like git but working trough this course
            allowed to become more familiar and comfrotabe working with it which
            will incredibly important in the future because of how much version
            control is growing in the programming community.

          <h2>#2: Create a Front End App with React on Codecademy</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="menu">
          <body>
            This second course acted as a refresher for javascript, which I used
            in grade 9 but did not use last year so I had forgotten some of the
            pricniples. I was reintroduced to concepts I had already learned but
            I also learned many more complex coding concpets such as classes and
            objects. I will continue to use this knowledge of complex coding
            concpets in the future to create complex coding projects by
            utilizing classes and objects like what I did in the live coding
            challenge. The part of this course that impacted me the most was
            working with classes. I struggled to understand the difference
            between classes and functions when I began the course but as I
            continued using them in my code I began to understand the
            difference. In simple terms, classes help to provide structure to
            the code but they do not execute tasks, unlike functions which
            execute certain tasks.

        <h2>#3: Create a Backend App with JavaScript</h2>

        <div class="menu">
          <body>
            The third course I worked through on codecademy was the
            <strong>Create a Backend App with Javascript</strong>. This app had
            a bit of an overlap with the javascript learned in creating a
            front-end app with reacct, but there were a lot of new computer
            science principles that I learned.

      <div class="Project 1">
        <h2>#4: Cubing Workflow</h2>
        <div class="menu">
          This was the first project I worked through while working with a
          pyraminx. This project helped me to get a much more thorough
          understanding of algorithms and how they are used in everyday life and
          really hlped to work on my probem-solving skills. I will continue to
          use what I learned about solving the pyraminx and finding patterns
          when coding in the future. This will allow me to approach new and
          difficult coding problems with a new and better problem-solving
          perspective. The aspect of this course that impacted me the most was
          that for me, it was very challenging. I spent a long time struggling
          and being unable to solve the cube becauses I was not able to identify
          and learn the algorithms necessary to solve. It took me over a week to
          be able to finally start recoginizing patterns and using specific
          algorithms to solve the cube. The more I worked with the cube and
          became more comfortbale with it, the more I was able to identify
          certain patterns quicker and the time it took me to solve it was in
          general, decreasing steadily.

        <div class="menu">
          <h2>#5: Course on Algorithms</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="menu">
          This was the second project we did this year working with the pyraminx
          and the corner twisting pyraminx. While leading this course I was in
          charge of the team blindfold solve. While watching people communicate
          with their partners to solve the cube, I learned a lot about hat was
          the most efficient way to communicate and solve the cube in the least
          amount of times with the fewest moves. I will continue to use this
          information about what was the most effective way to communicate in
          the future when working with groups and others whether it's in
          computer science or in other classes as well. I found the groups that
          were most successfu were the ones who used specific vocabulary for
          each piece of the cube and some groups even labeled each piece before
          starting the activity so they would be on the same page. I foudn the
          groups thhat were less successful were the ones who didn't use specfic
          vocabulary and who got frustrated with their partners so I know that
          it is important to remain evel-headed and not get frustrated when
          working with others because it only makes things worse. I think seeing
          the different techniques and seeing the progress that people made
          throughout the course is what impacted me the most. I know that a lot
          of people were afraid of failing or of not being able to solve the
          cube but by the end I oculd see that they were much more confident
          with solving and I think seeing that progress was really great to see.
